# A namespace module for HTTP Message definitions used by HTTPClient.
#
# source://httpclient//lib/httpclient/http.rb#19
module HTTP; end

# Represents a HTTP message.  A message is for a request or a response.
#
# Request message is generated from given parameters internally so users
# don't need to care about it.  Response message is the instance that
# methods of HTTPClient returns so users need to know how to extract
# HTTP response data from Message.
#
# Some attributes are only for a request or a response, not both.
#
# == How to use HTTP response message
#
# 1. Gets response message body.
#
#     res = clnt.get(url)
#     p res.content #=> String
#
# 2. Gets response status code.
#
#     res = clnt.get(url)
#     p res.status #=> 200, 501, etc. (Integer)
#
# 3. Gets response header.
#
#     res = clnt.get(url)
#     res.header['set-cookie'].each do |value|
#       p value
#     end
#     assert_equal(1, res.header['last-modified'].size)
#     p res.header['last-modified'].first

# :main:HTTPClient
# The HTTPClient class provides several methods for accessing Web resources
# via HTTP.
#
# HTTPClient instance is designed to be MT-safe.  You can call a HTTPClient
# instance from several threads without synchronization after setting up an
# instance.
#
#   clnt = HTTPClient.new
#   clnt.set_cookie_store('/home/nahi/cookie.dat')
#   urls.each do |url|
#     Thread.new(url) do |u|
#       p clnt.head(u).status
#     end
#   end
#
# == How to use
#
# At first, how to create your client.  See initialize for more detail.
#
# 1. Create simple client.
#
#     clnt = HTTPClient.new
#
# 2. Accessing resources through HTTP proxy.  You can use environment
#    variable 'http_proxy' or 'HTTP_PROXY' instead.
#
#     clnt = HTTPClient.new('http://myproxy:8080')
#
# === How to retrieve web resources
#
# See get and get_content.
#
# 1. Get content of specified URL.  It returns HTTP::Message object and
#    calling 'body' method of it returns a content String.
#
#     puts clnt.get('http://dev.ctor.org/').body
#
# 2. For getting content directly, use get_content.  It follows redirect
#    response and returns a String of whole result.
#
#     puts clnt.get_content('http://dev.ctor.org/')
#
# 3. You can pass :follow_redirect option to follow redirect response in get.
#
#     puts clnt.get('http://dev.ctor.org/', :follow_redirect => true)
#
# 4. Get content as chunks of String.  It yields chunks of String.
#
#     clnt.get_content('http://dev.ctor.org/') do |chunk|
#       puts chunk
#     end
#
# === Invoking other HTTP methods
#
# See head, get, post, put, delete, options, propfind, proppatch and trace.
# It returns a HTTP::Message instance as a response.
#
# 1. Do HEAD request.
#
#     res = clnt.head(uri)
#     p res.header['Last-Modified'][0]
#
# 2. Do GET request with query.
#
#     query = { 'keyword' => 'ruby', 'lang' => 'en' }
#     res = clnt.get(uri, query)
#     p res.status
#     p res.contenttype
#     p res.header['X-Custom']
#     puts res.body
#
#    You can also use keyword argument style.
#
#     res = clnt.get(uri, :query => { :keyword => 'ruby', :lang => 'en' })
#
# === How to POST
#
# See post.
#
# 1. Do POST a form data.
#
#     body = { 'keyword' => 'ruby', 'lang' => 'en' }
#     res = clnt.post(uri, body)
#
#    Keyword argument style.
#
#     res = clnt.post(uri, :body => ...)
#
# 2. Do multipart file upload with POST.  No need to set extra header by
#    yourself from httpclient/2.1.4.
#
#     File.open('/tmp/post_data') do |file|
#       body = { 'upload' => file, 'user' => 'nahi' }
#       res = clnt.post(uri, body)
#     end
#
# 3. Do multipart with custom body.
#
#     File.open('/tmp/post_data') do |file|
#       body = [{ 'Content-Type' => 'application/atom+xml; charset=UTF-8',
#                 :content => '<entry>...</entry>' },
#               { 'Content-Type' => 'video/mp4',
#                 'Content-Transfer-Encoding' => 'binary',
#                 :content => file }]
#       res = clnt.post(uri, body)
#     end
#
# === Accessing via SSL
#
# Ruby needs to be compiled with OpenSSL.
#
# 1. Get content of specified URL via SSL.
#    Just pass an URL which starts with 'https://'.
#
#     https_url = 'https://www.rsa.com'
#     clnt.get(https_url)
#
# 2. Getting peer certificate from response.
#
#     res = clnt.get(https_url)
#     p res.peer_cert #=> returns OpenSSL::X509::Certificate
#
# 3. Configuring OpenSSL options.  See HTTPClient::SSLConfig for more details.
#
#     user_cert_file = 'cert.pem'
#     user_key_file = 'privkey.pem'
#     clnt.ssl_config.set_client_cert_file(user_cert_file, user_key_file)
#     clnt.get(https_url)
#
# 4. Revocation check. On JRuby you can set following options to let
#    HTTPClient to perform revocation check with CRL and OCSP:
#
#     -J-Dcom.sun.security.enableCRLDP=true -J-Dcom.sun.net.ssl.checkRevocation=true
#     ex. jruby -J-Dcom.sun.security.enableCRLDP=true -J-Dcom.sun.net.ssl.checkRevocation=true app.rb
#     Revoked cert example: https://test-sspev.verisign.com:2443/test-SSPEV-revoked-verisign.html
#
#    On other platform you can download CRL by yourself and set it via
#    SSLConfig#add_crl.
#
# === Handling Cookies
#
# 1. Using volatile Cookies.  Nothing to do.  HTTPClient handles Cookies.
#
#     clnt = HTTPClient.new
#     res = clnt.get(url1) # receives Cookies.
#     res = clnt.get(url2) # sends Cookies if needed.
#     p res.cookies
#
# 2. Saving non volatile Cookies to a specified file.  Need to set a file at
#    first and invoke save method at last.
#
#     clnt = HTTPClient.new
#     clnt.set_cookie_store('/home/nahi/cookie.dat')
#     clnt.get(url)
#     ...
#     clnt.save_cookie_store
#
# 3. Disabling Cookies.
#
#     clnt = HTTPClient.new
#     clnt.cookie_manager = nil
#
# === Configuring authentication credentials
#
# 1. Authentication with Web server.  Supports BasicAuth, DigestAuth, and
#    Negotiate/NTLM (requires ruby/ntlm module).
#
#     clnt = HTTPClient.new
#     domain = 'http://dev.ctor.org/http-access2/'
#     user = 'user'
#     password = 'user'
#     clnt.set_auth(domain, user, password)
#     p clnt.get('http://dev.ctor.org/http-access2/login').status
#
# 2. Authentication with Proxy server.  Supports BasicAuth and NTLM
#    (requires win32/sspi)
#
#     clnt = HTTPClient.new(proxy)
#     user = 'proxy'
#     password = 'proxy'
#     clnt.set_proxy_auth(user, password)
#     p clnt.get(url)
#
# === Invoking HTTP methods with custom header
#
# Pass a Hash or an Array for header argument.
#
#     header = { 'Accept' => 'text/html' }
#     clnt.get(uri, query, header)
#
#     header = [['Accept', 'image/jpeg'], ['Accept', 'image/png']]
#     clnt.get_content(uri, query, header)
#
# === Invoking HTTP methods asynchronously
#
# See head_async, get_async, post_async, put_async, delete_async,
# options_async, propfind_async, proppatch_async, and trace_async.
# It immediately returns a HTTPClient::Connection instance as a returning value.
#
#     connection = clnt.post_async(url, body)
#     print 'posting.'
#     while true
#       break if connection.finished?
#       print '.'
#       sleep 1
#     end
#     puts '.'
#     res = connection.pop
#     p res.status
#     p res.body.read # res.body is an IO for the res of async method.
#
# === Shortcut methods
#
# You can invoke get_content, get, etc. without creating HTTPClient instance.
#
#   ruby -rhttpclient -e 'puts HTTPClient.get_content(ARGV.shift)' http://dev.ctor.org/
#   ruby -rhttpclient -e 'p HTTPClient.head(ARGV.shift).header["last-modified"]' http://dev.ctor.org/
#
# source://httpclient//lib/httpclient/version.rb#1
class HTTPClient
  include ::HTTPClient::Util

  # Creates a HTTPClient instance which manages sessions, cookies, etc.
  #
  # HTTPClient.new takes optional arguments as a Hash.
  #  * :proxy - proxy url string
  #  * :agent_name - User-Agent String
  #  * :from - from header String
  #  * :base_url - base URL of resources
  #  * :default_header - header Hash all HTTP requests should have
  #  * :force_basic_auth - flag for sending Authorization header w/o gettin 401 first
  # User-Agent and From are embedded in HTTP request Header if given.
  # From header is not set without setting it explicitly.
  #
  #   proxy = 'http://myproxy:8080'
  #   agent_name = 'MyAgent/0.1'
  #   from = 'from@example.com'
  #   HTTPClient.new(proxy, agent_name, from)
  #
  # After you set :base_url, all resources you pass to get, post and other
  # methods are recognized to be prefixed with base_url. Say base_url is
  # 'https://api.example.com/v1/, get('users') is the same as
  # get('https://api.example.com/v1/users') internally. You can also pass
  # full URL from 'http://' even after setting base_url.
  #
  # The expected base_url and path behavior is the following. Please take
  # care of '/' in base_url and path.
  #
  # The last '/' is important for base_url:
  #   1. http://foo/bar/baz/ + path -> http://foo/bar/baz/path
  #   2. http://foo/bar/baz + path -> http://foo/bar/path
  # Relative path handling:
  #   3. http://foo/bar/baz/ + ../path -> http://foo/bar/path
  #   4. http://foo/bar/baz + ../path -> http://foo/path
  #   5. http://foo/bar/baz/ + ./path -> http://foo/bar/baz/path
  #   6. http://foo/bar/baz + ./path -> http://foo/bar/path
  # The leading '/' of path means absolute path:
  #   7. http://foo/bar/baz/ + /path -> http://foo/path
  #   8. http://foo/bar/baz + /path -> http://foo/path
  #
  # :default_header is for providing default headers Hash that all HTTP
  # requests should have, such as custom 'Authorization' header in API.
  # You can override :default_header with :header Hash parameter in HTTP
  # request methods.
  #
  # :force_basic_auth turns on/off the BasicAuth force flag. Generally
  # HTTP client must send Authorization header after it gets 401 error
  # from server from security reason. But in some situation (e.g. API
  # client) you might want to send Authorization from the beginning.
